# Quake Structural Integrity System
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=qsis.github)

We develop Quake Structural Integrity System (QSIS) to assist in monitoring the health of the civil structures such as buildings, bridges, dams, etc. The goal of the QSIS is to detect any signs of damage, deterioration, or other problems that could compromise the safety and stability of a structure. By continually performing structural health monitoring (SHM), we can take proactive steps to repair or replace components before they fail, thereby ensure the longevity of the structure and ensuring the safety of residents and beneficiaries.

The QSIS Seismic Network (QSN) has currently 40 strong-motion stations located in Taipei, Taiwan. It continually monitors the health of the civil structures by analyzing the recorded 3D strong-motion waveforms in real-time and extracting the impulse response for each structure. The QSN is currently concentrated in Taipei region, but the plan is to expand it over several structures of significance in Taiwan.
